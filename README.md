## Hey 👋, I'm Cooper!

I’ve been programming for almost **9 years**, and love learning about anything. I'm a first year math student at the University of Waterloo, and a huge proponent of [open source software](https://opensource.org)!

### Projects
* [Centichess](https://centichess.org), a chess game review service that uses stockfish web workers to analyze your chess games and provide feedback.
* [Twine](https://github.com/cooper-ross/twine), a C++ compiler for my own language with direct LLVM IR code generation (Assembly).
* [Racket Prep](https://racketprep.com), a platform that lets you practice Racket code in the browser!

### Interests

* AI Safety Research: thanks, in great part, to Robert Miles. Some of the best introductory videos for the field I've ever seen.
* Math/logic puzzles: check out Daniel Litt, he has some lovely unintuitive coin flip or present opening ones.
* Chess, soccer, and hockey!

### Stack

* **Languages**: JavaScript, C++, C#, Python, Java, Assembly (getting there), HLSL, GLSL.
* **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Next.js, Bootstrap, jQuery, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.

### Achievements

* **First Place Overall** at **CalgaryHacks** in 2024 (my first ever hackathon!)
* **Gold Medalist at Skills Alberta** 3x Winner  Web Development, **Skills Canada 2025**
* Representing **Canada** at **WorldSkills 2025** in Shanghai for Web Technologies
