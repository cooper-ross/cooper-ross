## Hey 👋, I'm Cooper!

I’ve been programming for almost **9 years**, and love learning about anything. I'm a first year math student at the University of Waterloo, and a huge proponent of [open source software](https://opensource.org)! I don't have a personal site yet, but I'll get to it eventually. 

As for projects I'm proud of, check out [Centichess](https://centichess.org), a chess game review service that uses stockfish web workers to analyze your chess games and provide feedback; [Twine](https://github.com/cooper-ross/twine), a C++ compiler for my own language with direct LLVM IR generation; and [Racket Prep](https://racketprep.com), a platform that lets you practice Racket code in the browser!
