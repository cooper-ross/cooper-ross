## Hello, I'm Cooper!

I’ve been programming for almost **9 years**, and I'm a first year math student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca). I'm interested in AI Safety Research (thanks in great part to Robert Miles), math puzzles (check out Daniel Litt), as well as chess, soccer, and hockey!

#### Projects I'm proud of:
* [Centichess](https://centichess.org), a chess game review service that uses stockfish web workers to analyze your chess games and provide feedback.
* [Twine](https://github.com/cooper-ross/twine), a C++ compiler for my own language with direct LLVM IR code generation (Assembly).
* [Racket Prep](https://racketprep.com), a platform that lets you practice Racket code in the browser!

#### Some achievements:

* **First Place Overall** at **CalgaryHacks** in 2024 (1/400, my first ever hackathon!)
* Representing **Canada** at **WorldSkills 2025** in Shanghai for Web Technologies

Thank you for reading!
