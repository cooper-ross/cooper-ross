## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Cooper!

Joined Github **4** years ago, this is my school account.

* I'm currently interested in ML, specifically language models and vision!
* My favourite language is probably JavaScript (I know), but a close second is C++ (hopefully that redeems me)
* I love making websites, developing games, and solving puzzles.
* I'm learning assembly (or at least attempting to).
* I've been programming for 8 years!
